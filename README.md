# YT-ScamDatabase
---------------------
Welcome to the database containing many scam channels and videos on youtube! I hope you find this list interesting and feel free to use the list as you wish. If you find any channels or videos that may not be scams and are incorrectly displayed, please make a post in [issues](https://github.com/Incrypters/YT-ScamDatabase/issues) and I will take a look and take action. Stay safe!‚ù§Ô∏è

## How do I use/interpret the dataset?

-------------------
For the .JSON format, the first ID is the channel ID and the second ID is the video ID. The video ID is shorter then the channel ID. Each video corresponds to the channel that uploaded it.

-------------------
For the .txt format, the ID on top is the channel ID. It is longer then the video ID. The ID on the bottom is the video ID. Each video is uploaded by the channel ID above it.

## Where does this data come from?
The data shown is collected from my very own Scam Scanner bot on my [Discord Sever - Scam Finder](https://discord.gg/fpJbN4kBEk). The bot uses specific search queries using the Youtube API on Google Cloud to find scam videos and channels. This repository serves as a hub to list these results.üôÇ

## What are uses of this dataset?
Almost all of the dataset contains videos that promote malware. This makes the dataset a great way to find fresh malware samples for testing and cybersecurity purposes! Additionally, you may report these bad actors and try to take down videos and channels. This list may also be used in 3rd party applications to block these scam videos and channels from showing up.‚úÖ
